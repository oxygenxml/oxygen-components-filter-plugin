# oxygen-components-filter-plugin
This sample plugin allows customization of oXygen XML Editor components like menus, toolbars, views, and actions. For instance, you can                 use it to filter out the actions you do not use in the menus or toolbar. For more technical details see http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-oxygen/index.html?q=/doc/ug-oxygen/concepts/components-validation-plugin.html

## Installation

This add-on is compatible with Oxygen XML Editor (or XML Author) version 17.0 or higher. 

To install it the add-on, follow these instructions:

1. Go to **Help->Install new add-ons** to open an add-on selection dialog box.
2. Enter or paste https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygenxml/oxygen-components-filter-plugin/master/addon.xml in the **Show add-ons from** field.
3. Select the **Components Filter** add-on and click **Next**.
4. Read the end-user license agreement. Then select the **I accept all terms of the end-user license agreement** option and click **Finish**.
5. Restart the application.

Result: 
This type of plugin can be used to remove various toolbar and menu actions or various visual components from an Oxygen standalone installation by modifying its "filter.xml" configuration file.
As a default behavior the plugin removes the "Grid" editing mode.

To find out information about the components you want to filter, set the **components.validator.run.mode** property to **developer** by uncommenting the following line in the **plugin.xml** file: 
```
<property name="components.validator.run.mode" value="developer"/>
```

In this execution mode, the sample plugin logs every component validation request by outputting in the application console messages with the following format:

    Validate [component_type_description] ([node_path_in_filter_file]): [component]
    
where:
   1. **[component_type_description]** is the description of the validated component (for example syntax highlight marker, accelerator action or content type)
   1. **[node_path_in_filter_file]** is the path of the node that can be inserted in the filter.xml file to filter the component
   1. **[component]** represents the component that can be filtered

Example

The sample plugin logs the following line when the editor asks for **Grid** page validation:

      Validate editor page (filter/editorPage/pageID): Grid
      
This means that if you want to filter out the Grid page you should have the following content in the filter.xml file:

      <filter xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="filter.xsd">
       <editorPage>
        <pageID>Grid</pageID>
       </editorPage> 
      </filter>
